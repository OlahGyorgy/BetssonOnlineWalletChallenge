Overview
This is a code challenge for prospective QA Engineers in PAM (Player Account Management)
to work for Betsson.

It is expected that all points are addressed.
This challenge covers:
• Service-level unit testing
• End-to-end RESTful API testing

System Under Test (SUT)
The sample code contains a simple microservice written in C# using the .Net 8.0 platform.
This is a simple Online Wallet solution that can be used for depositing and withdrawing
funds as well as retrieving the balance.

Deliverable
You can follow the instructions in the Readme file to build and run the microservice using
Docker. All test code should be written in C#.
You are expected to design and implement:
1. unit tests for the service layer of the Online Wallets microservice.
2. API tests that target the exposed endpoints of the microservice.

Notes
• The code should compile.
• All tests should execute successfully.
• The codebase should be added to a repository on your personal GitHub and you
should make frequent commits. Codebases with a single large commit will not be
accepted.
